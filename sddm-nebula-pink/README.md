# Nebula SDDM Theme

**Nebula** is a modern, futuristic, dark glassmorphic SDDM login theme inspired by Hyprlock. It features sleek neon accents, frosted glass effects, an elegant centered card layout, fluid micro-animations, and custom QML components. It is built to run on modern Qt6-based SDDM environments.

---

## Features

- **Glassmorphism Card**: Frosted glass card styled in a rich, dark emerald hue (`#cc061a12`) with elegant borders that glow vibrant neon green (`#00ff8f`) when the password field is focused.
- **Massive Digital Clock**: A prominent, bold digital clock using the Bebas Neue typeface.
- **Dynamic Greetings**: Greets the selected user with context-sensitive greetings ("Good Morning", "Good Afternoon", "Good Evening") and shows the formatted local date.
- **Custom Password Input**: Uses expanding neon dot indicators and a custom pulsing cursor line for a premium lockscreen aesthetic.
- **Fluid Animations**: Smooth parallel entry animations on startup and a physical "shake" feedback animation on failed login attempts.
- **Control Dock**: A sleek floating bar at the bottom containing session selection, user selection (visible when multiple users exist), and a system power menu (Shutdown, Reboot).
- **Customizable**: Background wallpaper, blur activation, and blur strength are configurable via a configuration file.

## Installation

For detailed step-by-step instructions, please refer to the [setup.txt](setup.txt) file, or follow the steps below:

1. **Install Prerequisites**:
   Ensure you have the required Qt6 QML modules installed for your distribution:
   - **Arch Linux**: `sudo pacman -S sddm qt6-5compat qt6-declarative qt6-svg`
   - **Fedora**: `sudo dnf install sddm qt6-qt5compat qt6-qtdeclarative qt6-qtsvg`
   - **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt install sddm qml6-module-qt5compat-graphicaleffects qml6-module-qtqml qml6-module-qtquick-layouts qml6-module-qtquick-controls`

2. **Copy Theme Files**:
   Create the theme folder and copy the repository contents:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/sddm/themes/nebula
   sudo cp -r CustomComboBox.qml Main.qml metadata.desktop theme.conf assets fonts /usr/share/sddm/themes/nebula/
   ```

3. **Set Permissions**:
   Ensure the files are readable by the system `sddm` user:
   ```bash
   sudo find /usr/share/sddm/themes/nebula -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
   sudo find /usr/share/sddm/themes/nebula -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
   ```

4. **Activate the Theme**:
   Add or update the current theme configuration. We recommend using a separate config file under `/etc/sddm.conf.d/`:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/sddm.conf.d
   echo -e "[Theme]\nCurrent=nebula" | sudo tee /etc/sddm.conf.d/10-theme.conf
   ```

## Testing the Theme

You can test the installed theme in a window on your current desktop session (without logging out). Run:

```bash
# On systems running Qt6 SDDM (Recommended)
sddm-greeter-qt6 --test-mode --theme /usr/share/sddm/themes/nebula

# On older systems running Qt5 SDDM
sddm-greeter --test-mode --theme /usr/share/sddm/themes/nebula
```

---

## Configuration

You can customize the theme properties in `/usr/share/sddm/themes/nebula/theme.conf`:

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `background` | String | `assets/background.png` | Relative path or absolute path to the background wallpaper. |
| `blur` | Boolean | `true` | Toggles background wallpaper blur (`true` or `false`). |
| `recursiveBlurRadius` | Integer | `8` | Controls the radius/intensity of the blur effect. |
| `recursiveBlurLoops` | Integer | `4` | Controls the quality/passes of the recursive blur filter. |

## Troubleshooting

- **Black screen or missing graphics on startup**:
  This is typically caused by missing QML libraries. Ensure the Qt6 Graphical Effects compatibility module (`qt6-5compat` on Arch or `qt6-qt5compat` on Fedora) is correctly installed. Check logs using `journalctl -u sddm`.
- **Fonts look incorrect**:
  The theme loads fonts directly from the `fonts/` subdirectory. If they fail to load, install them locally by copying `fonts/*.ttf` to `/usr/share/fonts/TTF/` and running `fc-cache -fv`.
